# viper-lineups
Repository of Viper lineups compiled across all maps from VALORANT.

## Recently added
* Companion Google Slides
* Fracture lineups
* Icebox lineups

## Companion Presentation
I made a companion Google Slides presentation for those of you who may want
to navigate the repo more visually instead of having to go through the files
themselves. It is available
[here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tJEMLTtrF2vh2O0bRA_accIyaOCCfrMZkq9-FbtKnGs).

## To-do
* Update Bind and Breeze lineups to reflect Patch 4.0 map changes
* Add support for 4:3 lineups for HUD-dependent lineups
* Improve the fracture lineups from videos found on reddit
    * Create file to dump URLs of interest
